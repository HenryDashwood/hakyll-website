# Blogs

A list of blogs, newsletters, and publications that I read and like

## General Interest

### [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/)

The best blog on the internet. Scott Alexander would be my guess for the contempory writer most likely to be cited in the next century.

### [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/)

Tyler Cowen is an inforvore. He coined the term I think. He and Alex Tabarrok push new content every day along with a host of links. It is nominally a very good economics blog, but my favourite posts are those that discusss the arts and travel.

### [Nintil](https://nintil.com/)

José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente has written some very impressive stuff. This year he has mostly been summarising the state of aging reseach so perhaps it should be grouped under science. However, he also writes about lots of other things so I included it here.

### [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index)

Another blog that could be grouped under science but feels broader. Gwern Branwen writes about so much that your best bet is to just go to his homepage and browse around.

### [Dominic Cummings Blog](https://dominiccummings.com/)

Oh yeah this gets a mention. It's actually full of interesting stuff and exposed me to all sorts of new ideas. Reading this in 2015, including Dom's long essay _Some Thoughts on Education and Political Priorities_, prompted me to learn to program, get into machine learning, and not chase the PPE dream. So I really have to thank Dom for my career. Whether Dom's worldview matches reality is rather beside the point for me.

## History and the Arts

### [A Clerk of Oxford](https://aclerkofoxford.blogspot.com/)

Probably the blog I'm most likely to recommend if asked, Eleanor Parker writes about medieval literature. She often posts the original followed by a translation and brings it to life with her own writing.

### [History for Atheists](https://historyforatheists.com/)

Tim O'Neil is an atheist who got annoyed by other atheists making a hash of their history. However, you should read this, and his previous blog [Amarium Magnum](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.com/) for really good book reviews and essays about the fall of Rome and the medieval world.

### [The Analogue Antiquarian](https://analog-antiquarian.net/)

Every two weeks comes a new post in an ongoing series. First there was the history of ancient Egypt from the perspective of those who rediscovered it. Then came ancient Greece told through its myths and then its histories. Ongoing is his series on people's attempts to uncover the mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.

### [Age of Invention](https://antonhowes.substack.com/)

Anton Howes's newsletter on the industrial revolution is a terrific read from someone at the cutting edge of the field.

### [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/)

The world's greatest back catalogue. I tend to skip the pieces that cover current events since they tend not to age well. But some contributors like Adam Tooze always get a read.

### [New York Review of Books](https://www.nybooks.com/)

Not as good as the London Review of Books. But still good.

## Science

### [Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)

My favourite science magazine. Quanta covers advances in maths and science and hits the sweetspot between too shallow and too deep every time.

### [Shtetl Optimized](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)

Scott Aaronson writes about Quantum Computation, complexity theory and liberalism. The go to source if you want to be up to date with advances in the first two, many of which come from him and his students!

### [In the Pipeline](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/)

Derek Lowe writes about medical science and has been particularly good reading in a year when advances in medical science have been the most important story in the world.

### [Not Even Wrong](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/)

Peter Woit writes about Physics. He's a strong critic of string theory and often posts friendly correctives to articles in Quanta.

### [Dorigo's Blog](https://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor)

Tomasso Dorigo writes about particle physics. He often posts good explainers of work carried out using data from CERN. Very useful for learning about what they do beyond e.g. proving the existence of the Higgs.

### [Information Processing](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/)

Steve Hsu is a remarkable person, with feet in the worlds of physics and genetics. His blog covers both of those and more.

## Technology

### [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/)

Benedict Evans writes about the tech industry on his blog and in his weekly newsletter. I don't quite know how to phrase this, but he has a knack for distilling events into ideas that make the world seem clearer.

### [Bloomberg NEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/)

Lots of good pieces on the state of various decarbonisation technologies with forecasts for their adoption.

### [Increment](https://increment.com/)

A publication from Stripe Press. Lots of stuff about managing software teams but my favourite posts are those about the history and development of various projects. We should have more histories like those.

## Politics

### [Palladium Magazine](https://palladiummag.com/)

In the 20th century, the free world had to meet the challenge of communism. With new ideas like Keynesianism and social democracy, old fashioned liberalism was able to emerge triumphant. We now face a new form of totalitarianism in the CCP but the governments of Europe and America are complacent. Palladium explores ideas that we may need if liberalism is to make it through the 21st century.

### [The Scholar's Stage](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/)

Tanner Greer writes about lots of things and I could have placed him in the History and Arts section. However, I will place him in politics as his area of expertise is China and Taiwan.

### [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/)

This is a new publication from the ASI crew. It's very good.
