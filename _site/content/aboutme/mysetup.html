<p>I think it’s a good idea to write about how I would hypothetically recreate my configurations for various things. I don’t have anything particularly exiting to share. However, even fairly typical configurations are built up over many hours so it’s probably worth documenting.</p>
<h3 id="terminal">Terminal</h3>
<p>We begin on any machine with a terminal. I have never used a Windows machine for programming, or a desktop version of Linux. On MacOS I would go and download <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. I don’t actually know, even after several years of using it, what it does that the normal Mac terminal doesn’t. It has a prettier icon though which was why I got it.</p>
<p>Inside the terminal for my shell I use <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">ZSH and Oh My ZSH</a>. It has nice autocompletion and the tab button is useful.</p>
<h3 id="text-editors">Text Editors</h3>
<p>I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> for anything substantial and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for anything that will only take a few seconds. You can see my settings.json and .vimrc files here.</p>
