<h5 id="october-2019-to-present---curation">October 2019 to Present - Curation</h5>
<p>Curation is an ESG risk monitoring platform. Projects I have worked on there include: Replacing boolean search queries used by our editorial staff to find relevant stories with modern ULMFit style classifiers. Rolling out automated summarisation of news articles using models from Huggingface’s Transformers library such BART. Developing a web app for data annotation, which makes use of active learning in a similar way to Prodigy, for editorial staff to quickly label articles before deploying models to find similar items. Creating a tool for extracting events from stories and displaying them in chronological order. Writing and adapting web scrapers for various tasks to do with data gathering.</p>
<h5 id="january-2019-to-june-2019---talkspace">January 2019 to June 2019 - Talkspace</h5>
<p>I interned on the data science team at Talkspace in New York. My main task was to build a model to recognise a set of dialogue acts developed by our chief medical research scientist. These are used as features when predicting downstream tasks like client recovery or retention. Other projects included clustering messages clients left during offboarding and extracting summaries from transcripts for clinical reports. I also did a lot of research into different approaches to transfer learning in natural language processing.</p>
<h5 id="april-2018-to-november-2018---sharemob">April 2018 to November 2018 - Sharemob</h5>
<p>Sharemob are the creators of the app My Talking Pet. It animates the faces of animals in photographs and adds a recording made by the user. The user has to place markers over certain facial features before the app can manipulate the photo correctly. I built and deployed a model to detect these key points which currently runs in production.</p>

<h5 id="september-2016-to-2019---university-of-buckingham">September 2016 to 2019 - University of Buckingham</h5>
<p>My degree included lots of practical modules based around C++ or Matlab. It culminated in a final dissertation project. In my case this was a portfolio of chess AIs such as alpha beta minimax search with iterative deepening, Monte Carlo tree search, an agent trained on human gameplay data, and one that relies on self play based upon AlphaZero.</p>
<h5 id="april-2016-to-august-2016---codeclan">April 2016 to August 2016 - CodeClan</h5>
<p>CodeClan is Scotland’s first digital skills academy. During the intense 4 month course we covered object oriented programming and test driven development in Ruby, Javascript and Java. We used these skills to build web and Android applications that also used PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. After learning the fundamentals of each language, we used frameworks to build more advanced applications. These frameworks included Sinatra, Rails, Express, and React.</p>
