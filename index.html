                  I began studying Economics at Exeter but decided that I wanted to be a part of the forces changing the world for the better, rather than observing them from the sidelines. Having spent four months at a digital skills academy in Edinburgh called CodeClan, I am now a Computer Science student at the University of Buckingham. I will graduate in 2019. Most of my university work has been in C++ while in my free time I taught myself Python and machine learning with various resources online. I have also tried to get as much work experience over the past two years as possible. As an intern at Woba Media, creators of the popular app My Talking Pet, I built a convolution neural network detect facial features in animals. I recently returned from a six month internship in New York with Talkspace, a company providing an asynchronous therapy platform, which introduced me to many interesting natural language problems. I am a good verbal communicator who is keen to take on whatever challenges are presented and build a reputation as a dependable member of a team.
