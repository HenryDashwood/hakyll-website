            <h5>October 2019 to Present - Curation</h5>
            <p>
              Curation is an ESG risk monitoring platform. Projects I have
              worked on there include: Replacing boolean search queries used by
              our editorial staff to find relevant stories with modern ULMFit
              style classifiers. Rolling out automated summarisation of news
              articles using models from Huggingface’s Transformers library such
              BART. Developing a web app for data annotation, which makes use of
              active learning in a similar way to Prodigy, for editorial staff
              to quickly label articles before deploying models to find similar
              items. Creating a tool for extracting events from stories and
              displaying them in chronological order. Writing and adapting web
              scrapers for various tasks to do with data gathering.

            <h5>January 2019 to June 2019 - Talkspace</h5>
            <p>
              I interned on the data science team at Talkspace in New York. My
              main task was to build a model to recognise a set of dialogue acts
              developed by our chief medical research scientist. These are used
              as features when predicting downstream tasks like client recovery
              or retention. Other projects included clustering messages clients
              left during offboarding and extracting summaries from transcripts
              for clinical reports. I also did a lot of research into different
              approaches to transfer learning in natural language processing.
            </p>
            <h5>April 2018 to November 2018 - Sharemob</h5>
            <p>
              Sharemob are the creators of the app My Talking Pet. It animates
              the faces of animals in photographs and adds a recording made by
              the user. The user has to place markers over certain facial
              features before the app can manipulate the photo correctly. I
              built and deployed a model to detect these key points which
              currently runs in production.

            <h5>September 2016 to 2019 - University of Buckingham</h5>
            <p>
              My degree included lots of practical modules based around C++ or
              Matlab. It culminated in a final dissertation project. In my case
              this was a portfolio of chess AIs such as alpha beta minimax
              search with iterative deepening, Monte Carlo tree search, an agent
              trained on human gameplay data, and one that relies on self play
              based upon AlphaZero.

            <h5>April 2016 to August 2016 - CodeClan</h5>
            <p>
              CodeClan is Scotland’s first digital skills academy. During the
              intense 4 month course we covered object oriented programming and
              test driven development in Ruby, Javascript and Java. We used
              these skills to build web and Android applications that also used
              PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. After learning the fundamentals
              of each language, we used frameworks to build more advanced
              applications. These frameworks included Sinatra, Rails, Express,
              and React.
