            <p>
              I think it's a good idea to write about how I would hypothetically
              recreate my configurations for various things. I don't have
              anything particularly exiting to share. However, even fairly
              typical configurations are built up over many hours so it's
              probably worth documenting.

            <h3>Terminal</h3>
            <p>
              We begin on any machine with a terminal. I have never used a
              Windows machine for programming, or a desktop version of Linux. On
              MacOS I would go and download
              <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. I don't actually know,
              even after several years of using it, what it does that the normal
              Mac terminal doesn't. It has a prettier icon though which was why
              I got it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inside the terminal for my shell I use
              <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">ZSH and Oh My ZSH</a>. It has nice
              autocompletion and the tab button is useful.

            <h3>Text Editors</h3>
            <p>
              I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> for
              anything substantial and
              <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for anything that will only
              take a few seconds. You can see my settings.json and .vimrc files
              here.
