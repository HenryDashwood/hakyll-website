# Weltanschauung

There are some things you read that strongly affect the way you look at the world. I've started to gather a list of such things here.

[I can tolerate anything except the outgroup](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/) - Scott Alexander

The first Scott Alexander blog post that I read and the starting point for how I think about anything that could plausibly be labelled as politics.

[An apology for the builder](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A30880.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext) - Nicholas Barbon

People hate builders and property developers. It's rare to see a full throated defense of them. The antiquity of Barbon, the fact that any buildings from his time would be protected now, and the number of people who live in places that have been developed since his day and would resent the idea that we would be better off without their homes give this piece a weight that I don't think you get from contempory writing.

[The Leopard](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3247/9780099512158) - Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa

I think people oppose a lot of things because they don't like change. Yet there are other forces at play in the world and they don't wait for us. Standing athwart history yelling "stop" has consequences too. Sometimes if we want things to stay the same, or indeed get better, things will have to change.

[Shade](https://placesjournal.org/article/shade-an-urban-design-mandate/) - Sam Bloch

In some ways this is just another piece about bad urbanism in the US. Perhaps the image of millions of people forced to spend their days in the glare of the sun made it stick in my mind more than it would have. I think about it a lot though, especially when people complain that a building might cast a dreaded shadow.

[Whole Earth Discipline](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3247/9781843548164) - Stewart Brand

Some things are getting worse in the world, even as most things have been getting better. It's possible that the bad things might one day outway the good. Sometimes we have to turn around but sometimes the solution is to speed up.

[Empty Planet](https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3247/9781472142979) - Darrell Bricker, John Ibbitson

People are still worrying about overpopulation when the far more likely future is a reversal. Obviously forcasts like this can change a lot but this book should get you thinking about what the implications of low to negative population growth might be.

[What you think about landfill and recycling is probably totally wrong](https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/what-you-think-about-landfill-and-recycling-is-probably-totally-wrong-3a6cf57049ce) -
Robert Wiblin

Lot's of things seem important or effective but aren't. I include this piece because, beyond the specific issue it discussess, it reminds me to think about the absolute numbers at play in an issue and the way something is implemented instead of the way it gets described.

[Ads don't work that way](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/) - Kevin Simler

Sometimes adverts are about informing people about the existance of a product. But the adverts that never go away are about establishing common knowledge.
